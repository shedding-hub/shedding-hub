title: Upper Respiratory Tract Levels of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
  2 RNA and Duration of Viral RNA Shedding Do Not Differ Between Patients With Mild
  and Severe/Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019
doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiaa632
description: >
  The authors reports longitudinal viral RNA loads from the nasopharynx/throat in
  patients with mild and severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He also
  investigated whether the duration of symptoms correlated with the duration of viral
  RNA shedding. A total of 56 patients were included.

      The author collected serial upper respiratory tract samples (1 nasopharyngeal
      swab and 1 throat swab put in a single collection tube with 1 mL of trans- port
      medium) for real-time PCR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for all patients.

  "description": "Fecal samples were collected from 113 participants \"in a randomized controlled study of Peg-interferon lambda-1a versus a placebo control for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19.\" A total of 7,563 measurements were taken for 679 samples using seven distinct assays; assays were typically run in duplicates.\n\nSamples were initially collected using OMNIGene GUT collection tubes (OG) but subsequently replaced with Zymo DNA/RNA shield fecal collection tubes (ZY) because of better performance. There are consequently 14 analytes following the naming convention `{target gene E, RdRP, N1, or N2}-{genomic RNA (gRNA) or subgenomic RNA (sgRNA)}-{quantification method RT-qPCR or ddPCR}-{collection tube OG or ZY}`.\n\nThe reference event for temporal offsets in days is the day of enrollment.",

# Extraction for Natarajan et al. (2022)

[Natarajan et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2022.04.001) quantified fecal shedding of different SARS-CoV-2 gene targets in feces for 113 individuals, and their data are published across several files in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alex-dahlen/lambda_fecal_shedding/). For reproducibility, we consider commit `7affa71`. They obtained diverse data using different sample collection kits, different gene targets, and different quantification methods.

    Fecal samples were collected from 113 participants "in a randomized controlled study
    of Peg-interferon lambda-1a versus a placebo control for the treatment of mild to
    moderate COVID-19." A total of 7,563 measurements were taken for 679 samples using
    seven distinct assays; assays were typically run in duplicates.

    Samples were
    initially collected using OMNIGene GUT collection tubes (OG) but subsequently
    replaced with Zymo DNA/RNA shield fecal collection tubes (ZY) because of better
    performance. There are consequently 14 analytes following the naming convention
    `{target gene E, RdRP, N1, or N2}-{genomic RNA (gRNA) or subgenomic RNA
    (sgRNA)}-{quantification method RT-qPCR or ddPCR}-{collection tube OG or ZY}`.

    The reference event for temporal offsets in days is the day of enrollment.

  "description": "This study evaluated the transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load over time. Over six weeks, 230 healthcare personnel underwent 528 tests at the Cleveland Clinic. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained using RT-PCR targeting the N gene, and viral loads were calculated. Data were obtained from the combined dataset in the supplementary materials of Challenger et al. BMC Medicine (2022) 20:25 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02220-0).\n",

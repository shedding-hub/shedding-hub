# Extraction of Jones et al. (2021)

[Jones et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi5273) analyzed viral load data from 25,381 German cases, including 9519 hospitalized patients, 6110 PAMS cases from walk-in test centers, 1533 B.1.1.7 variant infections, and the viral load time series of 4434 (mainly hospitalized) patients. Viral load results were then combined with estimated cell culture isolation probabilities, producing a clinical proxy estimate of infectiousness. Data were obtained from the ['viral-load-with-negatives.tsv.zip'](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/SARS-CoV-2-VL-paper/blob/20210614/data/viral-load-with-negatives.tsv.zip) dataset in the GitHub repository of [Jones et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi5273). Samples lacking a known onset date or a detected positive test result were filtered out.

First, we `import` python modules needed:

```python
#import modules;
import yaml
import pandas as pd
from shedding_hub import folded_str, literal_str
```

Raw data ['viral-load-with-negatives.tsv'](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/SARS-CoV-2-VL-paper/blob/20210614/data/viral-load-with-negatives.tsv.zip), which is stored on [Shedding Hub](https://github.com/shedding-hub), will be loaded and cleaned to match the most updated [schema](https://github.com/shedding-hub/shedding-hub/blob/main/data/.schema.yaml).

Each individual has only one positive test at record. 
```python
df = pd.read_csv("/Users/fionaxiao/Desktop/ðŸ’©/SheddingHub/jones2021estimating/data/viral-load-with-negatives.tsv", sep="\t")
df_filtered = df.groupby('personHash').filter(lambda g: not (g['Ct'] == -1.0).all())
df_filtered['viral_load_extracted'] = 10 ** df_filtered['log10Load']

df_individual_positive = (
    df_filtered.assign(valid=(df_filtered["Ct"] != -1.0))
    .groupby("personHash", as_index=False)
    .agg(valid_Ct_count=("valid", "sum"))
)

df_individual_positive["valid_Ct_count"].unique()
```

We split into two datasets based on if people have onset information. 
df_with_onset â†’ people with valid onset info + reference_date_onset
df_without_onset â†’ people without onset info + reference_date_confirmation

```python
df_filtered['Onset'] = pd.to_datetime(df_filtered['Onset'], format='%Y-%m-%d', errors='coerce')
df_filtered['Date']  = pd.to_datetime(df_filtered['Date'],  format='%Y-%m-%d', errors='coerce')

g = df_filtered.groupby('personHash', group_keys=False)
has_onset = g['Onset'].transform(lambda s: s.notna().any())

# ----------------------
# Dataset 1: With onset
# ----------------------
df_with_onset = df_filtered[has_onset].copy()
df_with_onset['reference_date_onset'] = (df_with_onset['Date'] - df_with_onset['Onset']).dt.days

# -------------------------
# Dataset 2: Without onset
# -------------------------
df_without_onset = df_filtered[~has_onset].copy()

first_positive_date_by_person = (
    df_without_onset.groupby('personHash')
    .apply(lambda sub: sub.loc[sub['Ct'] != -1.0, 'Date'].iloc[0]
           if (sub['Ct'] != -1.0).any() else pd.NaT)
)

df_without_onset['confirmation_date'] = df_without_onset['personHash'].map(first_positive_date_by_person)
df_without_onset['reference_date_confirmation'] = (
    (df_without_onset['Date'] - df_without_onset['confirmation_date']).dt.days
)
```

reference_date is the number of days between the test date and the patientâ€™s reported symptom-onset date. Large positive and negative values mean the swab was taken well before or after they were infected. Those samples are irrelevant, so we drop any record with reference_date < -7 and >30.

```python
example = df_with_onset.loc[df_with_onset['personHash'] == "8bb13ce1d8b40383949ff842074f4040"]
example = example.reset_index(drop=True)
print (example)
```

```python 
# Without onset
df_filtered_without_onset = df_without_onset.loc[
    (df_without_onset['reference_date_confirmation'] >= -7) &
    (df_without_onset['reference_date_confirmation'] <= 30)
].copy()

# With onset
df_filtered_with_onset = df_with_onset.loc[
    (df_with_onset['reference_date_onset'] >= -7) &
    (df_with_onset['reference_date_onset'] <= 30)
].copy()
```

```python

participants = []

for patient_id, group in df_filtered_with_onset.groupby('personHash'):

    sex = ('female' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 'F'
                else 'male' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 'M'
                else 'unknown')

    participant = {
        'attributes': {
            'age': int(group['Age'].iloc[0]),
            'sex': sex, 
            'lineage': 'B.1.1.7' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 1 else 'unknown' 
        },
        'measurements': []
    }

    for _, row in group.iterrows():
        if row['Ct'] == -1:
            value = "negative"
        else:
            value = row['viral_load_extracted']
        measurementN = {
            'analyte': 'swab_SARSCoV2_onset',
            'time': row['reference_date_onset'],
            'value': value
        }
        participant['measurements'].append(measurementN)
    
    participants.append(participant)
    
for patient_id, group in df_filtered_without_onset.groupby('personHash'):

    sex = ('female' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 'F'
                else 'male' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 'M'
                else 'unknown')

    participant = {
        'attributes': {
            'age': int(group['Age'].iloc[0]),
            'sex': sex, 
            'lineage': 'B.1.1.7' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 1 else 'unknown' 
        },
        'measurements': []
    }

    for _, row in group.iterrows():
        if row['Ct'] == -1:
            value = "negative"
        else:
            value = row['viral_load_extracted']
        measurementN = {
            'analyte': 'swab_SARSCoV2_confirmation',
            'time': row['reference_date_confirmation'],
            'value': value
        }
        participant['measurements'].append(measurementN)
    
    participants.append(participant)
```

Finally, the data is formatted and output as a YAML file.

# Extraction of Jones et al. (2021)

[Jones et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi5273) analyzed viral load data from 25,381 German cases, including 9519 hospitalized patients, 6110 PAMS cases from walk-in test centers, 1533 B.1.1.7 variant infections, and the viral load time series of 4434 (mainly hospitalized) patients. Viral load results were then combined with estimated cell culture isolation probabilities, producing a clinical proxy estimate of infectiousness. Data were obtained from the ['viral-load-with-negatives.tsv.zip'](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/SARS-CoV-2-VL-paper/blob/20210614/data/viral-load-with-negatives.tsv.zip) dataset in the GitHub repository of [Jones et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi5273). Samples lacking a known onset date or a detected positive test result were filtered out.

First, we `import` python modules needed:

```python
#import modules;
import yaml
import pandas as pd
from shedding_hub import folded_str, literal_str
```

Raw data ['viral-load-with-negatives.tsv'](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/SARS-CoV-2-VL-paper/blob/20210614/data/viral-load-with-negatives.tsv.zip), which is stored on [Shedding Hub](https://github.com/shedding-hub), will be loaded and cleaned to match the most updated [schema](https://github.com/shedding-hub/shedding-hub/blob/main/data/.schema.yaml).

```python

df = pd.read_csv("viral-load-with-negatives.tsv", sep="\t")
df_filtered = df.groupby('personHash').filter(lambda g: not (g['Ct'] == -1.0).all())
df_filtered['viral_load_extracted'] = 10 ** df_filtered['log10Load']
df_onset_filtered = df_filtered.groupby('personHash').filter(lambda g: (g['Onset'] != '?').any())
df_onset_filtered['Onset'] = pd.to_datetime(df_onset_filtered['Onset'], format='%Y-%m-%d', errors='coerce')
df_onset_filtered['Date']= pd.to_datetime(df_onset_filtered['Date'], format='%Y-%m-%d', errors='coerce')
df_onset_filtered['reference_date'] = (df_onset_filtered['Date'] - df_onset_filtered['Onset']).dt.days
print (df_onset_filtered['reference_date'].unique())
```
reference_date is the number of days between the test date and the patientâ€™s reported symptom-onset date. Large negative values mean the swab was taken well before they were infected. Those samples are irrelevant, so we drop any record with reference_date < -7 and retain only tests taken from 7 days before onset onward.

```python
example = df_onset_filtered.loc[df_onset_filtered['personHash'] == "8bb13ce1d8b40383949ff842074f4040"]
example = example.reset_index(drop=True)
print (example)
df_onset_filtered_case = df_onset_filtered.loc[df_onset_filtered['reference_date'] >= -7].copy() # The specific number of dates could be changed 
```

```python

participants = []

for patient_id, group in df_onset_filtered_case.groupby('personHash'):

    sex = ('female' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 'F'
                else 'male' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 'M'
                else 'unknown')

    participant = {
        'attributes': {
            'age': int(group['Age'].iloc[0]),
            'sex': sex, 
            # 'lineage': 'B.1.1.7' if group['Gender'].iloc[0] == 1 else 'unknown' 
            # after filtering the df, all the lineage is not B.1.1.7 (unknown), should we still keep it? 
        },
        'measurements': []
    }

    for _, row in group.iterrows():
        if row['Ct'] == -1:
            value = "negative"
        else:
            value = row['viral_load_extracted']
        measurementN = {
            'analyte': 'swab_SARSCoV2',
            'time': row['reference_date'],
            'value': value
        }
        participant['measurements'].append(measurementN)
    
    participants.append(participant)

```

Finally, the data is formatted and output as a YAML file.

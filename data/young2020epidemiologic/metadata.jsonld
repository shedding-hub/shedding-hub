  "description": "Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. The clinical course was summarized, including the requirement for supplemental oxygen, intensive care, and the use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. The numbers of positive stool, blood, and urine samples were small. Data for the nasopharyngeal swab results were obtained from the combined dataset in the supplementary materials of Challenger et al. (2022). The standard curve was calculated based on the concentration provided by Goyal et al. (2020).\n",

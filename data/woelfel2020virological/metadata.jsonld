  "description": "The authors conducted a virological analysis of nine linked cases of COVID-19 in Munich in early 2020. They quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA gene copies in throat swabs and RNA concentrations in stool and sputum samples. Abundances were quantified using RT-qPCR assays targeting the E and RdRP genes as described in 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045. Values were programmatically extracted from the figure, resulting in a number of significant figures far exceeding the performance of the assays. The demographic data, including age and sex, are derived from the Challenger et al. BMC Medicine (2022) 20:25 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02220-0 supplement combined dataset.",

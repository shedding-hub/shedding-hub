title: Upper Respiratory Tract Levels of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
  2 RNA and Duration of Viral RNA Shedding Do Not Differ Between Patients With Mild
  and Severe/Critical Coronavirus Disease 2019
doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiaa632
description: >
  The authors reported longitudinal viral RNA loads from the nasopharynx/throat in
  patients with mild and severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). They
  also investigated whether the duration of symptoms correlated with the duration
  of viral RNA shedding. A total of 56 patients were included.

    description: >
      The author collected serial upper respiratory tract samples (one nasopharyngeal
      swab and one throat swab were put in a single collection tube with 1 mL of trans-
      port medium) for real-time PCR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for all patients.

title: Single base substitutions in the capsid region of the norovirus genome during
  viral shedding in cases of infection in areas where norovirus infection is endemic
doi: 10.1128/JCM.01932-07
description: This study investigates norovirus (NoV) infections in Toyama Prefecture,
  Japan, during fiscal year 2006, focusing on viral shedding in feces. The study involved
  30 individuals from a local hotel outbreak in May 2006, with stool specimens collected
  and analyzed using real-time PCR. Two employees exhibited long-term viral shedding,
  with single base substitutions in the NoV capsid region observed. The study highlights
  the potential for NoV evolution in the gastrointestinal tract, with genetic changes
  occurring during the infectious course. The research was supported by a Health Labor
  Sciences Research Grant from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.

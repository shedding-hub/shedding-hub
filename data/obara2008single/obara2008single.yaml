title: Duration of Norovirus Shedding in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Food Handlers
doi: 10.1128/jcm.01932-07
description: >
  This study investigates the duration of norovirus RNA shedding in two food handlers—one
  symptomatic and one asymptomatic—using repeated real-time reverse transcription-PCR
  tests on fecal specimens. Norovirus RNA was detected and quantified over time, and
  the duration of viral shedding was compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic
  individuals.

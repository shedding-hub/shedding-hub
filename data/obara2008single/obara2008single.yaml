title: Single Base Substitutions in the Capsid Region of the Norovirus Genome during
  Viral Shedding in Cases of Infection in Areas Where Norovirus Infection Is Endemic
doi: 10.1128/jcm.01932-07
description: "This study investigates the duration of norovirus RNA shedding in two\
  \ food handlers\u2014one symptomatic and one asymptomatic\u2014using repeated real-time\
  \ reverse transcription-PCR tests on fecal specimens. Norovirus RNA was detected\
  \ and quantified over time, and the duration of viral shedding was compared between\
  \ symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.\n"
analytes:
  stool_Norovirus_log10copies:
    description: >
      Quantitative measurement of norovirus RNA in stool samples using real-time RT-PCR.
      Results are expressed as log10 copies per gram of feces.
    specimen: stool
    biomarker: norovirus
    genotype: GII.4
    limit_of_quantification: unknown
    limit_of_detection: 4
    unit: gc/wet gram
    reference_event: confirmation date
  norovirus_presence_qualitative:
    description: >
      Qualitative detection of norovirus RNA in stool samples using real-time RT-PCR.
      Results are recorded as 'positive' or 'negative'.
    specimen: stool
    biomarker: norovirus
    genotype: GII.4
    limit_of_quantification: unknown
    limit_of_detection: unknown
    unit: gc/wet gram
    reference_event: confirmation date
  norovirus_ct_value:
    description: >
      Cycle threshold (Ct) values from real-time RT-PCR detection of norovirus RNA
      in stool samples. Lower Ct values indicate higher viral load.
    specimen: stool

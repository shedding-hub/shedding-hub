    biomarker: SARS-CoV-2
    description: SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome copy concentration in throat swab samples.
      Specimens were collected from all patients at least 2 days after hospitalization
      and physicians checked their symptoms and signs daily.
    gene_target: RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes

description: The authors measured SARS-CoV-2 in longitudinal throat swab samples collected
  from 3 presymptomatic patients and 10 patients with entirely asymptomatic infections
  identified from 71 cases between February 4 and April 7, 2020. Abundances were quantified
  using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Specimens were collected
  from all patients at least 2 days after hospitalization and physicians checked their
  symptoms and signs daily. Patients who had asymptomatic carrier and incubation period
  were analyzed.

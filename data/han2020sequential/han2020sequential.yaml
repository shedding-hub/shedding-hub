title:
  Sequential Analysis of Viral Load in a Neonate and Her Mother Infected With
  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
description:
  The study reports SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in different specimen types for a neonate and
  her mother diagnosed on 2020-03-20. The study includes nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal,
  stool, plasma, saliva, and urine samples. Only concentrations in stool samples are
  reported here. Viral loads were extracted manually from Figure 1 using
  [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io).

    description: "From manuscript: \"Viral RNA was detected using the
      PowerChek 2019-nCoV real-time polymerase chain reaction kit (Kogene Biotech,
      Seoul, Korea) for amplification of the E gene and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
      region of the ORF1b gene, and quantified with a standard curve that was
      constructed using in vitro transcribed RNA provided from the European Virus
      Archive.\" However, data reported in Figure 1 explicitly refer to the E gene
      target."

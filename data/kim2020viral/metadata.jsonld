  "description": "The authors present viral load kinetics for the first two confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate illness in Korea. Swabs, sputum, serum, plasma, urine, and stool samples were collected throughout the illness. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were quantified using rRT-PCR targeting the RdRp and E genes. Data were obtained from the supplementary material.\n",

  "description": "This study reported the epidemiological and clinical features of ten children infected with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and tested for evidence of viral excretion through the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. A total of 107 samples in both of nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected and ct values were recorded by days after admission. The standard curve of transforming ct value into viral load was calculated based on the concentration provided by the author.\n",

title: Detection of hepatitis A virus RNA in saliva
doi: 10.1128/JCM.42.9.4329-4331.2004
description: This study, conducted from November 2002 to November 2003, investigated
  the presence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA in saliva and serum samples from six
  acutely infected patients with HAV viremia. The study was conducted at a hospital
  in France, and the participants were aged between 15 and 47 years. The study aimed
  to explore the potential of using saliva samples for outbreak investigations due
  to the ease of collection. HAV RNA was detected in the saliva of five out of six
  patients, with viral loads in saliva being 2 logs lower than in serum. The study
  utilized RT-PCR and real-time PCR assays for detection and quantification, with
  a focus on the VP1/2A junction of the HAV genome. The study also included phylogenetic
  analysis to determine HAV genotypes.
analytes:
  serum_hav_rna:
    description: HAV RNA was extracted from 140 μl of serum using the QIAmp viral
      RNA kit. RT-PCR was performed to amplify a 512-bp fragment encompassing the
      VP1/2A junction. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay was 43 IU/ml. HAV RNA was
      quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay on the LightCycler instrument with
      a sensitivity of 600 genome equivalents/ml.

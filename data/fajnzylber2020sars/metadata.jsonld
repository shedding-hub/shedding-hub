  "description": "The paper quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load from participants with a diverse range of COVID-19 disease severity, including those requiring hospitalization, outpatients with mild disease, and individuals with resolved infections. Blood was collected from hospitalized participants, non-hospitalized symptomatic individuals seeking care at a respiratory infection clinic, and participants who had recovered from known COVID-19 disease. Nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and urine were collected from hospitalized participants. Data were obtained from the supplementary materials.\n",

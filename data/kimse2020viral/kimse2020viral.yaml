title: Viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients
doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.083
description: The authors measured SARS-CoV-2 in longitudinal throat swab samples collected
  from 71 COVID-19 patients between February 4 and April 7, 2020. Abundances were
  quantified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
  Specimens were collected from all patients at least 2 days after hospitalization
  and physicians checked their symptoms and signs daily. Patients who had asymptomatic
  carrier and incubation period were analyzed.

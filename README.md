# Shedding Hub [![Shedding Hub](https://github.com/shedding-hub/shedding-hub/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shedding-hub/shedding-hub/actions/workflows/build.yml)

The Shedding Hub collates data and statistical models for biomarker shedding (such as viral RNA or drug metabolites) in different human specimen (such as stool or sputum samples). Developing wastewater-based epidemiology into a quantitative, reliable epidemiological monitoring tool motivates the project.

Datasets are extracted from appendices, figures, and supplementary materials of peer-reviewed studies. Each dataset is stored as a [`.yaml`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file and validated against our [data schema](data/.schema.yaml) to verify its integrity.
